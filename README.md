# Bank-Acoount-in-Python
I have created a bank account class that has two attributes:  owner and balance and two methods:  deposit &amp; withdraw. As an added requirement, withdrawals may not exceed the available balance.  Instantiate your class, make several deposits and withdrawals, and test to make sure the account can't be overdrawn.
